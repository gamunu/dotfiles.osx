# Dotfiles for macOS

This repository lists all the dotfiles I use on my macOS machine. The repository is structured in a way that allows me to easily install the dotfiles on a new machine. The dotfiles are managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), which is a free, portable, lightweight symlink farm manager.
